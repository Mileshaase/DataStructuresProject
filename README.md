# DataStructuresProject
 Project 3 for Data Structures, created by Miles, Kinnara, and Sallie

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 In order to run this program, one must open the project either on the itch page: https://magisterimperium.itch.io/movie-magic or in a Unity project. 
 
 _ (On the itch page it is recommended to open the window in fullscreen in order to see the full picture. The webbuild might not display the title or show some wonky visuals, but everything should work fine, we blame itch for this issue :) )
_
 Users can select genres from the main screen, and then the sorting factors as well as the sorting methods. 
 
 Hitting the search button will generate the top five movies from the factors the user selected, and at the bottom will show how long the method took to run.
 
 The user can then click the Make Another Search button to reset and try again.
